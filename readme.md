hello!

you can find the rust code in /src folder
there will be 2 files

main.rs -> implementation with rust shared state
main-redis.rs -> i was in a good mood so i decided to implement this with redis as well

so if you want to test the redis implementation, just rename the file to main.rs

also i have a docker-compose.yml file for you to run the redis server
